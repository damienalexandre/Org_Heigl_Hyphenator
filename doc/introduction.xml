        <classname>Org\Heigl\Hyphenator</classname> is a package to enable 
        word-hyphenation in PHP. It uses the algorithms described by Marc Liang
        in his thesis Word Hyphenation by computer and the extensions described
        by ?? in his work ??. 
    </para>
    <para>
        These algorithms are based on matching words against certain patterns 
        that describe places inside a word where hyphenation is possible or 
        must not occur. This Hyphenator uses the pattern-files from OpenOffice
        which are based on the pattern-files created for TeX.
